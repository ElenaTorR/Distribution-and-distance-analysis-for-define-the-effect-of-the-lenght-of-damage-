# Distribution-and-distance-analysis-for-define-the-effect-of-the-lenght-of-damage-
This notebook shows an alternative use of distribution and distance analysis in order to see how the lenght of damage can change the data. This is just an experimental work where I've just started to play with data.

I generated some plots for doing some preliminary analysis. Click on the PNG files.
